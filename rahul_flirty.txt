Because I didn‚Äôt see you in my hottest singles last week 
Cos I don't know where I was going with that one
your smile is my favourite
Wanna use their money to buy drinks
But, you look like you're into Stranger Things
You: "damn, I thought this would be the beauty and the beast, but it is the child and the priest
Because you look like a snack
Really
I kinda figured you'd be my type
I‚Äôd enjoy waking up to you
Because I'd die to get inside you
But I can turn you into mine
Cause you‚Äôre hot as fuck but i don‚Äôt see a future between us
And if you're free I'll take you out sometime
Because I‚Äôd love to sit down with you and get to know you better with some coffee
I wouldn‚Äôt just give you a tip
I‚Äôd give you the whole thing
Which suprised me because you're definetly a 10
Some people might say you're flat, but deep down we all know you have amazing curves
Because you sure know how to raise a cock
But they won‚Äôt let me bring my own snack
Come back to my place, and we can spread the word
(She says yes I do) Damn
It's like a French kiss, But down under
Cause you're beautiful every night and I miss you every day
There's no way they could improve your smile
They don‚Äôt allow snacks in
Want me to hold it
because im definitely going to fuck this up
And we'll talk about the first thing that pops up
DaVinci painted Mona, cause he couldn't find you
On second thoughts I am okay sugar coating them too
The smile you gave me :)
That way you would blow me
Because I can't get over you
Because I‚Äôm going to beat you in front of the kids
But you could help me clap some alien cheeks, because that ass is outta this world
Cause I want to look at you for hours
I don't want you falling for anyone else
üòâ
Cause you really know how to make a wiener stand
What are my chances of getting head
Oh
It's beauty
we'd make a great pair
But I‚Äôm still a wizard under the sheets
Made this one myself, hope it is good
Because time slows down when I'm near you, you're hot, I'm attracted to you, and once I'm near you I have a hard time getting away
Also works as a breakup line: girl, you must be a neutron star because you're dense AF and weigh a ton, it's painful to be near you and I can't get away from you
Because you look smaller in person
Because I want to put my kids in you
‚Äòcause i‚Äôm never letting you leave me
Because I see that dress disappearing at midnight
Because my eyes can't focus on anything but you
Because I can't have you fall for anyone else
Cause your a 1/10
Because I've got swimmers for you to swallow
You might not see it easily, but it exists infinitely
Just thought because your dress is going to disappear at midnight
Cause someone told me you have a crush on me
Cuz I wanna hang with you
Cause you make me rock hard
Because I like to put the d in raw
You‚Äôre a 9 and I‚Äôm the 1 you need
Not because you look like a snack, but because you look like the kind of girl who will do anything for ¬£1
Cause I saw that crack and knew I had to have some
Because I want you just the way you are
Because you never start conversations with me
Cuz i would want to lay under you
Cause the chessboard ain't the only place you gonna get into every position tonight
Cause when you bite you give me an uncontrollable erection for hours till I die
Because you are Au Ti S Ti C
I think X is 15 because U are a 10
Together we'd be pretty cute
Because you extra fine
I like spaghetti, let's go fuck
Cuz I wanna tame you with my bone
I could see you twice
but when I think of a world without you it becomes very unexciting
Cuz I want your seed
Cause your unreal
Because I wanna bury my face inside you
cause i need new contacts, specifically urs :)
Because you‚Äôre really fucking loud and annoying
every time I look at you, I smile
When you broke through the Earth's crust ascending from hell
I'd love to give you my heart
I'll expand in your ass 
cause I don't give a fuck about what you say
Cause I could use you to enchant my life
Because I wanna fill ur cheeks with nut
Would they like to meet mine
you need me inside you
Because you're radiating me to the point that I am growing a hump
Honey do you know how fine you look tonight
because when i look at you everyone else disappears 
got fine written all over you
Because I miss having you around
so next time you go you should bring me to be safe
You're also my rainstorm because you make me hella wet ‚ù§
You sit on my face and I guess how much you weigh
Because I wanna mash, add some milk then watch over you and keep you warm for hours
Cause I can‚Äôt get over you
I'm trying to figure out how much beauty sleep one needs to look that good
Because you are sodium fine
Because you have my private‚Äôs standing at attention
‚Äòcuz i wanna give u my bone
Cause I wanna flip you over and dig my face in you
Because you‚Äôre the full package
Just kidding, it‚Äôs because you are so hot, you‚Äôre on fire
Because you‚Äôve been looking right all night
I'll lay on my back, and you can blow me to hell
Because I desperately need your approval
Because i feel like i just went past your event horizon
Cause you're getting hotter every second
Cuz i love you
Damn, I wanted to send you a cute message and you're the cutest thing I could think of
Cus im digging you
Cause I wanna smash you until all the white stuff comes out
Cuz I'd love to get in the bath with you
But you and me
We could be a pear
üçê
They both wiggle when you eat them
Cuz I'm McLovin it
Hey girl you're a 9/10, and I'm the 1 you need
Because my dog likes you on my penis
Why dont I join in
Beauty is on the inside and I haven‚Äôt been inside of you yet 
And you still take my breath away
Cause I want you on top of me in bed
Because I want to smash you
Let me hold it for you
Because you give me butterflies
Because I would like to have sexual intercourse with you but only if you allow it
If not I would like to tell you that you look beautiful today
Because I'd do anything to get to that moon of yours 
Cause Yoda one for me
you can expect more than a few inches tonight
He is I and you are art
Cause I wanna go take a bath with you
Because I like to flip you over when it's getting hot
Hello, 911 emergency, there‚Äôs a handsome guy in my house

You look like the kind of girl that could use two
Girl, you‚Äôre like an itchy rash

Because you‚Äôre causing an uprising down south
Cause i think we should turn my room into OUR room
Because you make 70% of me highly reactive
Cause you're finger licking good
Because I swear that ass is calling me
Cause your body rocks
Because I want you to meet my family
Because it's pumping inside you and I'm not 
Because I want to use and then lose you and forget I ever knew you
When I‚Äôm around you, you make me very‚Ä¶ HAPPY
I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is aloe you very much
Cause I wanna fill you with religious intent
because my love for you is unbreakable <3
Cause I really need you
I somehow want to relate it to her being hot or something along those lines
Any help is appreciated
Then you're the best thing I've ever come up with
Fill me with meat and sour cream
I‚Äôm pretty good with numbers
Tell you what, give me yours and watch what I can do with it
But for me it starts with U
Now all you need is some cream filling
oh wow, you would fit perfectly into my life
Cause I‚Äôll hold for you
You just stung my heart
Cause I wanna take you out
Because i can't ever get enough of you in my bed 
Because you just caught my eye
It'll even stand up and give you somewhere to sit
Because I'm gonna take a megabyte out of your ass
Because you're the proseCUTEST
Because I have a certain cellar I want to keep you in
Can I crash at your place tonight
I'd put your Tulips and My Tulips together

U be the iceberg and I‚Äôll go down on u
I want to show Santa what I want for Christmas
Because I find you appealing
üçå
Because I think my heart just took off
You'd have a dollar
Cause I'm tryna spread it
I'll bring the wood
As someone who deeply cares about the environment, I am obligated to pick you up
Is 6 pm okay
Cause I spent over nine hours watching you last weekend
Because I‚Äôm going to bang you on every piece of furniture in the house
‚Äòcause it‚Äôs the good kind of fat
cause i want you altima self
The head of my Big Dipper pointing right at you
Because I want you to taste this meat
Because you have yet to call me DADDY üòâ
Because you are hotter than the devil
Cause the first time I took a peek at you I was electrified
Cause I can't stop looking at you
I'd explore ya
That the W key on my keyboard has fallen for me
I'm not letting you fall for anyone else
Because I can picture you and me together
Because you are unbelievable 
my nickname for you is gonna be nicolio-  because much like polio, you're making my knees week"
I'd shove my nut in your hole
because you make me think irrationally
Because I want to ride you all night long
If convicted you could receive 5-10 solid dates
Because I want to avoid you at all costs
cause you've been running in my mind all day
*wipes face* take a seat here
Its never ending
Because you are really hot
Because I am definitely feeling a connection
I‚Äôd put my nuts in you
Because I have the STD and all I need is u
Cuz I never want you in my house
But I'd be happy to put my body parts inside you
Cuz I keep falling for you
Because baby, you're so fine
I would be DNA helicase, so that I could unzip your genes
Because I can‚Äôt get you out of my head
Because you look like a keeper
coz weed be cute together
You‚Äôre the box I‚Äôd want to come in
How free are you today
Because I want to get you lit and put your butt in my mouth
I matched with a girl (not) named Arya
You don't seem to have a name
But it's alright, you can scream mine tonight
I will poke you with the pointy end, if you throw a Game of Thrones pun at me again
Should I marry her
I am skeptical, I like my posts read, not my wedding
Well, that was my plan for you later
We are probably going to die soon
I want to know what it's like before that happens
It‚Äôs like a French kiss, but down under
Cuz i wanna ride you
Because I wanna put my hot dog in you until it explodes
In my pants
Because i broke my leg falling for you 
Because I'd love to take a bath with you
Cause you take my breath away
Cause you just shattered the ceiling of how beautiful I thought a women could be
Because you're smoking
Cause I‚Äôd slam you on some sheets
Been using you with dming a girl
Cause I wanna drive you crazy and smash you in to the wall
Because your body is really hot
Because you're the answer to all my prayers
I don‚Äôt know, and I cant define it
But I think I can recognize it when I see it, and I‚Äôm looking at it now
I'd have one dime 
cuz baby, u never leave my mind
Because i can't sleep when i think about you
Because you make me go weak in my knees
Cause I'd wait an eternity for you at the airport
Then you'll love my personality
When I look into them, my nuts tighten
Cause I‚Äôm lost without you
I was hoping we could kick it
Oh you are
It must be 15 minutes fast
Just because I always lose my opportunity 
We can start with a big bang
Cause every masterpiece has one
It doesn't have you listed as the hottest single
Because if you were unexpectedly on my bedroom floor right now I'd be going down on you whether I liked it or not
Are you corn
Cause i wanna stalk you
We should do it together sometime
what perfect was until I met you
'Cus those are some beautiful peaks
Anytime
You‚Äôd be Babe-raham Lincoln
Cuz i wanna slam you on my desk, and do you all night long
Then do I get the tail
Cause I'd like a happy ending
Because your all sugar and curves
Because I‚Äôm paying you a lot of interest 
Because I wanna spread you on my bed
Cuz you sure are my bae-max üôÉ
i'm nike & you're mcdonald's, i'm doin' it & you're lovin' it
Because I may get a little Rachel
Yeah, probably not a winner and only works for one name
I find them hot and then leave them wet
What, when I fell from heaven
You're a snack
So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm following you
Because you‚Äôre beautiful and not enough people know about you
Cause you always leave me turned on 
But now that i see you, i know what ive been dreaming of all this time
Because it's wrapped around you and I'm not
Cause I wanna visit Djibouti
cuz heaven called, they want their cantaloupe back
Because I want you to see what is inside of me
Cause I wanna be Putin my dick in you
But don‚Äôt we have plans to have sex tonight
Cause your butt look like out of this world
Hey are you the afterlife
cuz I‚Äôm dying to get into you 
because I‚Äôm the one you need
Cause you take my breath away
Wow, you even have the same name 
Look, we already have something in common
I'm doing this cuz he's been trying and no girl will go out with him
He even stopped throwing mashed potatoes on the ceiling
He's getting discouraged
cuz i‚Äôd love to piss on u
Cuz you‚Äôre the only thing missing from my life
What are my chances of getting head
Cause it must be illegal to be this Fine
The word of the day is legs
Let‚Äôs go back to my place and spread the word
Because i wanna stick my fingers in all 3 holes
Cause if so why are you unveiled
Sharia Law states at a publicly indecent woman can be subject to eternal home arrest by her closest male relative if deemed necessary
Because I know almost nothing about you, but this feeling in my stomach makes me want to take you out üòÅ
Because I wanna drop a baby in you
Cause it‚Äôs gonna take me a lot to drag me away from you
'Cause you've got my interest
Cause my mom told me to follow my dreams
Cause you've got some curves
my place, tomorrow, me and you
It‚Äôs finger licking good
Because you got my interest
You're both acute
While I explore your cave of wonders
Or do you want to try my wand instead
cuz i think about you a lot
Cause you‚Äôre dope
Cause i wanna plant my seed in your hole
Cause mmmmmmmmmmm
Because you've got my interest
I just made you cum with my voice, guess what I can with my hands
Cause I'm from New Zealand
I don‚Äôt think so
Yes you did, you dropped your standards
Or can I call you mine
Cause you a snack and I'd love to see you smile back 
Cuz I‚Äôm kneeding you
Because I want to Bangladesh
Because I‚Äôm gonna bang you for a while at the kitchen table
But you‚Äôre looking like a dime
Tied to a cross 
Like a thot
Because i want you to choke me daddy 
Because I wanna grow old with you
Because I like you without dressing
Because I‚Äôd like to take you home
Cuz you sure are Imprezing me
You‚Äôre first
Cause I'd jump off a roof to have you on my arm
Because I'd like to take the integral so I can learn more about the area underneath them
Heads I am yours, Tails you're mine
And you matter
Nature is just trying to balance cause you're so hot
Because you look like a tin
Cause your like nothing I have ever seen on this earth
I want to turn "my house" into "our house"
And it lead me to you
Cause I can see you holding my balls
Because I can see myself in your pants
‚ÄòCause dat ass is calling me
Because you really extend my piston
Like, at least five
Very good goat
Cause I'm cos^2 (x), and together we'll be one
Cause you look sodalicious
Because you're always turning me on
because you‚Äôre on my to do list
Because you're extra curvy
Hey I need your help here, cause you see I'm pretty bad at pick up limes
Because I want to drop a kid in you
This ain‚Äôt just another cheesy pickup line, can we get coffee sometime
What's up
Cause you take my breath away
Want to taste the rainbow
I don‚Äôt want you to fall for anybody else
Because you're the only ten I see
Because after i give ya 8" its hard to walk around
Which is crazy, because I'd only last about 15 seconds in Uranus
üòé
because I wanna go mate
Because you raise my cock
Cause you looking right
Sorry, was that not acute pickup line
But in all reality, I think we'd be complementary together
Just let me supplement that ass
Because I could never leave you
Because we make a great pair
Because I want to take a bath with you
I dropped mine when you walked by
Cause I think you'd perform well undercovers
Because I have low confidence and humour is my coping mechanism
Because i want to pollinate your bee-hind
Because you are lookin excessively fine
Especially U
Because I put the d in raw üòò
We should make it so the letter D is silent when it comes after the letter M, that way you could put a D in me and nobody would ever know
I was kissing his cheek and he was smiling, and when i stopped and laid back on his lap i heard him whisper ‚Äúgod i love you‚Äù
And i love him too
i told him i loved him too
I have never seen someone so happy to hear three little words
He‚Äôs amazing and i pray to be with him for as long as fate allows
I didn't pull you aside enough, to kiss you passionately, to tell you I love you, to make you smile for no reason at all
I did those things, not enough though
I didn't humble myself enough for you, make you feel special unannounced, convince you how much you were worth when you didn't need convincing
I didn't cuddle you enough, make myself uncomfortable to lay closer to you, or sacrifice my time enough for you
I thought I was doing good, when really I could've done so much better
It's all waiting for you when you come back
I promise, love
In the middle of the night I got up to pee, came back to bed, got undressed again and cuddled up next to him sleeping
He wrapped his arms around me and whispered ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù
I asked him what he‚Äôd said, even though I heard, and he replied ‚ÄúI love you so much‚Äù
I was speechless, shocked but so happy
I just hugged him tighter
It was glorious
when i tell you i love you
i say it to remind you that you're the best thing that ever happened to me
He‚Äôs not much of a chef, but he still tries for me
Bless him
This dope has no idea what he‚Äôs doing, but he‚Äôll still try his damn best if it means I can lay in bed a little longer
Little moments like this make me realise how lucky I am to have such a wonderful man
I love you, bean
‚ù§Ô∏è
It was a first of him sobbing to me
He told me he wanted me to touch him, so I cupped his face in my hands and held him as he cried into my lap
All I felt was a need to forever love and protect such a vulnerable soul when he gripped onto me and told me he'd always need me and love me
And I'll always love him
More than he could ever possibly know
When I take a nap or go to bed, I take one of my pillows, and cuddle it tightly till I fall asleep
It‚Äôs my alternative to cope with the loneliness of her not being the one I‚Äôm holding
Am I the only one
You can't get the person out of your head
You lose interest in all others of your beloved's gender
You start dreaming of your beloved
When your beloved embraces you, you get a feeling of 'being at home', no matter where you are
he's been my best friend for as long as i've known him, but he's also my first love
i couldn't have been happier if i tried
i'm now laying in bed next to him, just in complete awe of what i finally get to call my own
The other day I was cuddling with my boyfriend on his bed
I looked at his face and I couldn‚Äôt find any other words to say other than ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù 
He looked at me warmly and lovingly
I really love him
I cried so much that my boyfriend‚Äôs eyes began to water, and he rarely cries
This will be a memorable moment for the both of us
That's how I feel every time I see you
That rush of warm I've been anticipating after I've been that awful freezing cold
And I think that's what love is
My 3 year anniversary is this Halloween and we are still so in love with each other
It‚Äôs like we just got together, we were in the kitchen and he picked me up and swung me around
I was laughing and he put me down while hugging me and said ‚Äúgod, I live for that laugh‚Äù 
It makes me wanna cry
I love him so much
I‚Äôm in a relationship
Finally
This girl is my world
She doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôs enough for me
She is more then enough for me
I love her so much
I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è
We talked about us
We talked about why we are the way we are
We talked about what we appreciate about each other
We talked about our fears, our insecurities
I‚Äôve known this woman over 10 years and still we learn about each other
She is incredible and strong
I love her so much
I‚Äôm just feeling really thankful right now to have someone that I can share such a powerful connection with
I'm in love with beautiful girl with an amazing  personality
She's always so happy
Always smiling
I love being able to wake up and see her reflection in the mirror
I'm getting closer towards my dreams, and I hope I'm getting closer to finding you, whoever you are, wherever you are
There's still times when I feel weak, times when I feel like I may never find you, that maybe you are an illusion, but hope somehow manages to stay alive
I can only imagine the adventures we're gonna go on together, there's a beautiful world out there for the both of us
I don't know where you are, I don't know if you even exist, but I love you and I can't wait to meet your wonderful self
She is my world
it really is the small things that matter
that‚Äôs for us, but i want you to look after it
it‚Äôs for all our adventures we‚Äôre about to go on
my heart dropped
i couldn‚Äôt believe what he said
i‚Äôve finally found him
the universe has finally given him to me
a man who loves me and is willing to take me to be his forever
all the thing i could ever have needed i‚Äôve got, ive never felt such a love before and i am forever grateful
I met a girl a few months ago and instantly fell in love, when the first few dates were over
We took our time, met on a weekly basis and started texting all day long
Even though I 'knew' she had to be interested, since she was taking the time to see me every week, I was so overwhelmed by my feelings for her, that I ended up being afraid that I'd never get her, since she is so perfect
We are a couple now and I'm so in love that it's almost physically hurting me not seeing her for a few days
I would love to tell her, how much she means to me, but there are no words to do so
Until I find those words, let's just stay with: I love her
So much
I hadn't seen my boyfriend all day, he was the first to get home and into bed, shortly after he texted me saying the bed smelled like me
Then mentioned how good coming home to that was again when we saw each other later in person
Hearing that made me feel so loved
More so since I've been thinking a lot lately about how good he smells ‚Äî not his deodorant or cologne
him, his skin, his hair, just him
It feels so good to know that he thinks the same about me
I didn't think it was that big of a deal, but my girlfriend clearly did
When I got home to her in the evening I fell asleep waiting for her to come home from work
I woke up to her sitting at the end of the couch in a beautiful dress, and a freaking birthday cake with candles lit and everything
And then she pulls out 2 gifts for me, which are boardgames (we both love to play all kinds of games)
I love her so much
It was incredibly sweet and she's planned it so much
She even asked my mom behind my back what kind of cake I like
I've never met a person who would do so much for me
She's amazing, I love her to death
Because that‚Äôs me right now
#worthit
I know we aren't together yet
I can't wait to be with you
To do silly little things with you like going to the supermarket late at night like it's a cute late-night adventure
To dance around the kitchen while cooking with you
Even do the dishes with you
Being able to hold hands with you, give you surprise gifts just because I can
To sit and play games with you
To sit and listen to you rave about your hobbies and interests
To treat you like an absolute King
I want to watch you grow and succeed at everything you do
I'm already proud of you, and I already love you
Every day is one less day I have to wait before being with you
‚ù§Ô∏è
It was like something out of a dream
we were hanging out at a park all night
One thing led to another
It felt like all the stress and the bad thoughts about the society we live in just left more a few moments
Like time stopped
It was the happiest moments of my life
I wish I could relive it just one more time
I later went on to tear up from how happy I was
When my husband or I see the other curled up in a blanket or when we are cuddling we often say "you're so cozy" or "you're so cute and cozy" to each other
It's just one of our little things that make me feel all happy and soft inside
A quote from David Viscott that captures how I'm feeling currently beautifully :)
My lover and I are watching The Big Lebowski
She‚Äôs sleeping in my lap
I have never been so happy
And she has said the same
Love is real
I sure as hell do
I love every single thing about her
Her smile and laugh lights up my whole world and her body, in spite of her body confidence issues, is absolutely nothing but perfect to me
One particular thing that I notice and absolutely adore is how she looks when she wakes up
Her hair gets a little tangled and her eyes struggle to stay open for a little while, and it‚Äôs honestly the cutest thing ever to me
waking up next to you, in your arms, has been the greatest joy of my life
when i hold you, run my fingers through your hair, and give you those tiny burst kisses you like so much
it fills my heart with pure, wholesome, unadulterated happiness
this is what heaven must feel like
i can spend every waking second of my life right here
Holding her hands for the first time was the best thing that has ever happened to me
The warmth that I felt when she suddenly grabbed my hands while we were walking are still engraved into my memories
Well, things might not be the same now but the warmth i felt in my heart that day stays forever in my heart and still brings a smile go my face when i think about it
She told me she has a future
She made it
The worst of it is all over now
She wakes up in the morning and doesn‚Äôt want to die as soon as she opens her eyes
She goes to bed because she‚Äôs tired, not because if she stays up she‚Äôll just get more into her head and start having bad thoughts
She actually made it, when she didn‚Äôt even plan to make it to high school she made it to her senior year
She didn‚Äôt think she was going to have a future but she once told me she felt like she had one with me and if that‚Äôs the only thing I do in life, is make sure she has a future, I would die happy
She made it and I watched her make it here
Without the night time, we would never appreciate the daylight
Well now it‚Äôs her time to bask in the sun
She made it
The little things make all the difference
Your heart cannot take up two losses
But I would rather speak with passion than to be dull, for the sake of being ‚Äúcool‚Äù
I‚Äôm finally in a relationship
She thinks she isn‚Äôt good enough for me but she is my entire world and I would do anything for her
I‚Äôm so happy
Like maybe I‚Äôm weird but I have zero interest in hooking up with someone I‚Äôve know for 5 minutes no matter how hot they are
I really just want one person and have a connection with them and build a relationship off a that
I want genuine love
But my friends think it‚Äôs weird when I don‚Äôt wanna respond to guys on tinder who message me ‚ÄúHey your hot, wanna fuck‚Äù 
I much rather meet someone, have a connection, and then hookup
Idk maybe I‚Äôm an old lady but I don‚Äôt understand this ‚Äúfuck a bunch of guys‚Äù thing
Love is dangerous
It can warp you as a person when you have your heart ripped out by your first love
After that it‚Äôs never quite the same
You‚Äôll never love the same way again and you will never be as vulnerable
If you fall in love with someone truly worth it, nurture those feelings and that relationship
Be selfless, don‚Äôt get lost in defensive pride, that will only lead to resentment
That shit is lethal to love
Be patient and understanding
LISTEN to your partner and maybe it won‚Äôt end in a smoking ruin where you‚Äôre never the same again
The day I met my girlfriend (soon to be fiance) I drove three hours during a rain storm late at night to see her
I actually thought I was gonna die on the way to her place
When I finally arrived I was so nervous from meeting her and stressed from driving, but when I saw her in person my heart instantly calmed
She looked so beautiful even though she had just got out of the shower and was wearing baggy sweatpants and an oversized shirt
I had the biggest smile on my face
All we did then was eat pizza and watch a terrible movie while sitting on a bean bag chair because it was the only furniture she had in her living room
Honestly it was the best and most boring date I've ever had and I'm extremely grateful for it
He saw I wasn't okay, came over to the bed and just grabbed and held me, for hours
Only saying, 'I'm here if you need to talk about it, I'm here as long as you need' and he was, no words can express how much that means to me
Later in the same day I was driving and had another anxiety attack and he came and picked me up
Made me feel safe and took care of me
It made me feel truly loved
He browses reddit, so if he see's this, just know no words can express how appreciative I am of you
I love you
Its one of the hardest things to do for me, I'm quite tender hearted
When some people take three months to truly let go, it takes me three years
And when I finally let them completely go in my mind and heart, I actually feel a physical hollowness inside my chest
How does it make you feel to set someone free
My boyfriend is honestly the sweetest man I‚Äôve ever met, he‚Äôs so thoughtful and loving
I really lucked out with him
Boom, do what makes you happy said god and I did
Killed it, crushed it, nailed it
Married my best friend and now we get to hangout all the time
Through all the A holes and ungratefulls we made it here to a place of blissful happiness
I love you my heart, and my happiness keeps expanding with every little thing we do as a married couple
Sometimes things are hard to get right on the first try
As living breathing and thinking creatures, sometimes you need a little experience before being content with where you are
Love is no exception
Sometimes, you really love someone and it doesn't work out
It doesn't mean your romantic quarrels are helpless efforts
And it's not like you didn't love them
Your first love probably won't be your last
They are now happily together for over 5 years and they thank me again and again for introducing them to each other
He gave her the happiness I would never be able to
As I go through my struggles, looking at them smile gives me strength
What are some things you have done for your love without them noticing
This morning I woke up and made breakfast in bed for my girlfriend this morning
I saw her eyes light up a little, her cute smile, it warmed and melted my heart
She hugged me and gave me a sweet little kiss when I set the tray down in her lap, she whispered a cute little ‚Äúthank you‚Äù in my ear as I kissed her on the cheek
She‚Äôs my world
I couldn‚Äôt stop watching her a little as she ate and watched a movie
She gave me another gentle kiss as she finished eating, after that we cuddled for a little while
I love her so much
You are loved
I love you and the beautiful impact you make on this world
Keep shinning bright so we may see the beauty around us
I cannot imagine one day that I can no longer have you in my arms
I'm afraid that this dangerous life can take you away from me anytime
I could never sleep without knowing that you are home safe and sound 
Before anything happens in our everyday life, I want you to know that I'm absolutely in love with you
Please stay safe anywhere you go
I love you so much
She's the most amazing beautiful person I've ever met and she loves me for me and she supports for who I am and I've never felt so respected and cared about
There's no other girl in the world I love more
Today, I was on the other side of the planet from her
We were on the phone saying our goodbyes and I just blurted it out
She giggled a little bit and said it right back to me
Never felt happier in my whole life
I was planning on telling her when we saw each other in person
But I guess I just couldn‚Äôt wait to tell her
There‚Äôs is no better feeling than knowing someone else loves and cherish you
You can love hundreds and thousands of people in a lifetime and maybe those feelings will change
But when you are truly in love with someone, there is nothing that will ever fully rip you from those feelings
Other lovers, new experiences, years apart, even recognizing that the two of you ended up growing into two completely different worlds
there is no breaking free from being truly in love with someone
I can‚Äôt wait to meet the love of my life
Is he happy
Where will we meet
Or maybe I‚Äôll meet him after, when I take a gap year to travel
I‚Äôm excited to actually have a baby, I will hopefully have one in my late 20‚Äôs, early 30‚Äôs
I can‚Äôt wait to give them a life they will love and buy them pretty clothes, have days where we do baking and make a mess
I can‚Äôt wait for family holidays
It‚Äôs such a dorky little thing on paper but the tension was unreal
We stayed there for probably minutes
We‚Äôre a thing of the past, she had to leave to study abroad
I think I have to say something
However when I get the chance to sleep with my girlfriend its different
When she's all cuddled up next to me with her head on my chest and I feel her body all relaxed, my mind rests easier
It's very nice that she has that effect on me
I thought I had to love myself before i could love someone else, but that‚Äôs not true
When you meet that other person that gives you comfort, they‚Äôll show you how to love yourself and you‚Äôll love them for that
Who else loves this feeling
Tomorrow, I will tell you how I really feel about you
You were the one I was looking for, I really believe it
I love you
we‚Äôve said ‚Äúi love you‚Äù multiple times (when he first said ‚Äúi love you‚Äù i cried) but like
this was the first time he‚Äôs said ‚Äúi‚Äôm in love with you‚Äù and i cant stop fucjing crying i look so fucking stupid rn but im so unbelievably happy like fuckfijch i wanna marry this dude 
idk if its dumb bc we‚Äôre literally only 16 and haha teenage relationships usually dont last
but we‚Äôve both talked abt our future n shit n im so serious abt this dude he is my whole world god i am so happy and in love
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt love too deeply, till you make sure that the other person loves you with the same depth, because the depth of your love today, is the depth of your wound tomorrow‚Äù
Don't forget to love yourself, be proud of who you were, who you are and who you have become
Our past mistakes, past failed relationships don't define us
You are worth being loved no matter what and the right person will see that
If a person can't see your worth, that's their problem not yours
Smile and love yourself because you're worth it üíï
Love is the main force, essence and sense of the universe :)
We don‚Äôt really have anything in common personality-wise but we genuinely love each other and spend most of our days together and it‚Äôs so heartwarming that after all the banter and jokes we would go home and I receive lovely messages from most of them telling me how good it feels to spend time together
They‚Äôre never toxic and I never doubted that they‚Äôre the best thing to ever happen to me
I want to learn to let go of her and never look back regardless of how much it hurts me cause I don‚Äôt want to love someone who is one sided and who doesn‚Äôt care about me at all 
This time is so much different
There‚Äôs no pain when I think about how much I like you
You are different
you treat me so well, everything a SO should be is what you are
Nothing feels better than being in your arms
I didn‚Äôt realize what it really felt like to look into the eyes of the person you love, or are falling in love with, idk
It‚Äôs like time stops around us, all my anxieties and insecurities completely fade away
Not to mention how lovely holding your hand is, it was like my hand was made to fit into yours
I haven‚Äôt experienced a love like this before, it‚Äôs built up slowly, but nothing has ever felt so right
I‚Äôm falling for you, harder and harder every time we are together
A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you
My girlfriend gifted me a jar which contains 101 handwritten notes giving me 101 reasons why she loves me
The gift is so romantic and she is so beautiful
I tell her everyday how much I love her but I'm always out of words
We are so perfect together and it's beautiful to spend time with her
She is gorgeous, funny and smart
She is so close to me
Her happiness and well being means a lot to me
I love her so much
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I have so much baggage‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, I don‚Äôt have any nice luggage anyways‚Äù 
:)
Oh, I love him
It is an honor that we exist in the same space and time didn't choose to separate us by eons
The world is a better place with your soul in it
Laughing with you plucks anxiety out my heart, you are a gift to my lungs
Your past is not a threat, it's what brought you to me
I pray about you, still
I've showed you this post before but I just wanted to remind you again
And i don't know whether to be sad or happy lol
i guess mainly happy/sentimental
I can still appreciate and enjoy them even tho im lonely lol
She makes me the happiest person ever
I had a crush on her for literally months and we found out that we both like eachother
I'm taking her on a date on Saturday and I'm so excited
I love her so much she's so beautiful and kind and sweet and amazing
I don't know how I got this lucky
She's the loml and I love her so much
I just wanna make her always happy and feel safe and protected
I love her
I can't believe the Reddit -Love- community isn't searched often or written into enough
Would a man rather spend his weekend watching porn instead of going out and actively searching for that one particular girl he saw across the river last week
Perhaps love has simply vanished
one may assume, possess the viewer's feelings enough as to actually drain the human of seeing reality as the real canvas to the beautiful work of art called the search for one, true, real, eternal life together
I told a co-worker something like "all I want is a hug and like 10 gallons of coffee" as a joke and this little old Mexican lady appears out of nowhere and gave me a hug and this lil blessing in Spanish, and I haven't heard one since I was really young
It was like a big hug from family I can't see anymore and to this day I'm convinced she might have been an angel
i‚Äôve never been happier to see her again
we sat down and watched spider man and ate ice cream and fried chicken and we cuddled the whole time and it made me feel so good inside
i can‚Äôt stop thinking about it
I just gave my boyfriend a shirt of mine w my perfume so he can have a piece of me while i'm off for vacation all summer
Do guys like that
I miss you so fucking much
I miss your cute damn smile, your laugh, everything about you
You were different than any other girl on the planet
Every damn second spent with you
All the conversations, all the ‚Äúgoodnights‚Äù every damn thing that had to do with you
Now, when I can‚Äôt say I love you, I really, do love you  
Fuck i need you
Life seems completely pointless without you
I'm not a big dater or a guy who goes around hooking up
Sure I see plenty of girls that I'd like to fuck but running into someone I truly care about is totally different
The moment I lay eyes on them my heart starts pounding and I get butterflies in my stomach
The conversation goes well and everything feels natural, no BS or playing games
I tend to think of them a lot to and I actually care about them, they aren't just some sex object I want to fuck
yesterday, the guy I‚Äôve been in love with for like months told me he feels the same way about me
He‚Äôll probably see this eventually cause he‚Äôs the only person I actually know on Reddit lmao but I had to say it somewhere because I‚Äôm so happy :‚Äô)
I can't express how much I love this girl
She told me I'm the only one who believes in her and that's all that mattered to her
Now I'm beyond happy
We've been together for over 2 years now and she keeps inspiring me every day
My dream is to be a filmmaker and her successes make it easier to believe in this dream
We were laying in bed last night after a super long day
I asked him how we got here
He gave me a sarcastic answer about how we drove in the car to the house and started on the events of the day that got us to the physical place we were
I didnt say a thing because I know he knew what I meant
He then looked at me and said "I love you" and I responded "I love you too" and he replied "that's how" implaing that, that is how we got to where we are in our relationship today
Because we love each other, we care about each other and we trust each other
And that super simple answer to a very complicated question made me fall in love with him even more
I‚Äôm sure nobody wants to listen to me talk about my boyfriend, but i‚Äôm so fucking in love
Not only does he FULLY respect me as a woman, but he has the biggest heart i‚Äôve ever seen
He‚Äôs the most beautiful soul i‚Äôve ever encountered and i feel nothing but pure love
We have been together for over 7 months and we still act like how we did when we first started
I know this sounds crazy, but i know that i could spend the rest of my life with him
When we‚Äôre together it‚Äôs like nobody else matters
He tells me every second how proud he is that i‚Äôm his partner, and that i‚Äôm the most beautiful girl in the world
He‚Äôs helped me in more ways i can count, and he continues to remain patient
I‚Äôm so in love and i hope it stays that way
ü•ë
I have never felt more alive
Everything is different with her, all the old tropes from movies that make you roll your eyes is what I experience daily
I feel like I hit the lottery and instead of watching all the love and passion fade like all the other relationships I have been in, I get to see it get stronger
She is my best friend, my true love, and my universe
I tell him everyday but that doesn't feel like enough so I'll just post it here
My boyfriend thought I was sleeping and I was slightly awake enough to hear him and he was telling me how beautiful I was and how I‚Äôm his girl as well as he‚Äôs got me and will protect me
He kissed me on the forehead then rolled back to fall asleep
Little stuff like that is a sign your in a solid relationship
He was my crush but I was too afraid to ever tell him in fear I‚Äôd ruin our friendship
But he had a crush on me too and was brave enough to tell me, and I‚Äôm so glad he did
It‚Äôs such a surreal feeling and we still can‚Äôt believe it sometimes
I can‚Äôt quite believe how it all worked out
He‚Äôs honestly the most caring, loving, cutest, funniest and smartness person I‚Äôve ever met
He‚Äôs everything I could ever want :)
I never realized how much I love him until I saw him love her
When the doctors pulled her from my incision he said ‚Äúoh my God sweetie, she‚Äôs beautiful" 
When we got to the room for golden hour he was holding her after she and I did skin to skin and he had tears in his eyes and said he wanted to be a better person for her
He‚Äôs the best person
He‚Äôs my person
He‚Äôs our person
I love them both more than words can express, but man I love him
He‚Äôs so patient and kind and he loves me more than I deserve
I love this girl just soo much
She has made my world amazing and i just love her with all my heart
Sorry just had to get that off my chest
Not just love, but LOVE
I love my family, but I want to LOVE someone
I want to know what it‚Äôs like
I‚Äôve never been on a date, never had someone to be with, never had someone to talk to regularly, never had anyone interested in me
I‚Äôve had crushes, people I would love to be with, even though I barely know them
I want someone to feel safe with me, some one to wants no one more than they want me, someone who has the time of their life with me, and I want all of that for that person
I want someone who is there for me no matter what
I just want someone to love
Finally I found someone so good, so precious that it has to be dream
I would do anything for her literally anything
Finally I feel peace and happiness inside, and when I see her I can feel warmth filling my body
When I talk to her I know I can tell her everything
I want someone to love me, undeniably
I want to love someone with all my heart, unconditionally
I have so much love I want to give, I'd give it to anyone at this point, but only the right person
I'm growing impatient
Increasingly difficult to keeps these feelings deep down right now
The thought of someone loving me is a satisfying feeling, a feeling that makes me feel all safe and happy inside
A feeling I can't quite describe
He stood by me when nobody else did
He gave me his everything
He didn‚Äôt leave me when I messed up BAD
He motivated me to be a better person and work on myself
He showed me that maybe there is a light at the end of this dark tunnel I have been in for years
He made sure I didn‚Äôt drop out of school and continuously encouraged me to do my best
I have never felt this intense passion, love and care for anybody
I would sacrifice my all for him in a heartbeat
Because without him I probably would‚Äôve been gone
I just did and wanted to share it
Maybe it's just because I miss her but sometimes I cry out of love
She's such a gem and I'm so lucky that I guess this is my body's way of appreciating it
It's like a confetti of feelings and euphoria
Right now I'm in bed with a smile on my face and dried up tears on my cheeks after telling her goodnight
2 years together and it still feels like the first day
Ah, I'm about to fall asleep and then wake up in the morning happy
Can't wait
It‚Äôs only been a little over a year but it‚Äôs been the best year of my life
You given me so much happiness and hope for the future its unbelievable
I love every little thing we do together even if it‚Äôs absolutely nothing
I love the way you look when you wake up in the morning and you hairs all messy
I love comforting you when you come back from a hard day at work
I want to do so much with you whether it‚Äôs traveling or going on small romantic dates or cuddling up and watching Netflix
I want to spend the rest of my life with you, to someday eventually settle down in our own house wherever you want to live
I love you so much and here‚Äôs to our future, whatever it may hold
My sweetheart hasn‚Äôt been feeling well this week
While we were laying down and talking in bed after some dinner, he falls asleep on me
It‚Äôs been 50 minutes, he‚Äôs hugging my left arm, and his head still on my chest
I‚Äôm watching the sun set and there‚Äôs no place I‚Äôd rather be right now <3
I'm so happy and feel so lucky that I met the right person for me at such a young age, and that we ended up growing into adults who are still compatible
His love and support motivate me to live to my fullest potential
I can't believe how wonderful life is with him, even after ten years
How did you express your feelings to him/her
he made her so happy ,she forgot all the things that made her numb
He made her so happy,she didn't realize she fell in love
No matter what skeletons are in your closet - worst fears, insecurities, or doubts - I think I‚Äôd want you nonetheless
You‚Äôre already leaving such an imprint in my life and chemical imbalances in my brain that I‚Äôm left feenin for more
All other men seem to pale in comparison to the effect you have on me
It‚Äôs pretty simple: I want you
Find a home in my heart, for I want you to stay
In short: sometimes love can really really suck
My 10 y/o sister just kissed me [18F] on my cheek and said ‚Äúhave a better night than me, love you‚Äù before leaving my room to go to bed and i can‚Äôt stop thinking about it
How on earth did she even come up with that
Whatever it is, it melted my heart
There is honestly no one in this world I love anyone more than my sister she‚Äôs my everything
Anyone else wanna talk about loving siblings
I can‚Äôt get enough of her
Looking at her, feeling her skin, her hands, feet, neck, legs, Hell her whole body
I spent an hour watching her sleep
I get tearful sometimes just knowing how lucky I am and how grateful I am having her in my life
I hope this never ends
I‚Äôve lost so much over the years but it all just makes me appreciate her that much more
‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs okay to fight for someone who loves you
It‚Äôs not okay to fight for someone to love you
I got off work later than my SO today, and him just showing up at my workplace waiting for me to leave work put such a smile on my face
And then it started to rain, and so there we were: laughing and kissing in the rain
It made my day, probably entire rest of the week
I'm so happy and I just had to share
i rarely get to see him because of our busy school schedules, but each time we meet we make it worthwhile
tonight, i was just thinking about our most recent date where we just laid in bed together and took a nap, and for some reason i started crying
i miss him so much and it's so childish since i saw him so recently, but i love him so much and i hope he knows it too
I‚Äôm young, which says enough
When love is gone, it‚Äôs lack weighs more than its presence
What we want to be creates a gap between the truth and our imagination
The truth being our love as humans is completely broken
How beautiful
There‚Äôs an unneeded pedestal which love is placed upon where it‚Äôs set to be this perfect thing
Is its faults, it‚Äôs sore bones, and it‚Äôs rough voice not what leads us in
Does just its name not drag you in, like it does to me
The whisper of ‚Äúmy darling‚Äù claws my back, and I wake up
Is the thought of a perfectly, imperfect soul not what makes chills run down the spine
I‚Äôve been with this guy for four months today and every day he blows my mind with how thoughtful he is
I was dreading the walk back to my dorm when I got a text from him telling me to stay put, he was already on his way to pick me up
I adore this guy
He‚Äôs made me feel so wanted and needed and I couldn‚Äôt be happier
Fuck I‚Äôm in love I‚Äôm in so deep I don‚Äôt even know what to do
How am I supposed to tell him
Do I tell him
Should I let him say it first
I don‚Äôt want him to be freaked out or anything it‚Äôs been like three months but uh holy shit I am whipped and in entirely too deep
I also know he‚Äôs been stressed out lately and I don‚Äôt want to add to that but I love him A LOT and I don‚Äôt know if I can hold it back
He‚Äôs just so wonderful
He makes my heart happy idk I‚Äôm so scared and so sure of what I‚Äôm feeling
Yes you
You‚Äôre amazing
I've never felt like a stranger in my home
All I want to do is be with her
Even if you get rejected/the story ends badly
Having a nightmare of losing you a few days ago has shocked how much I love you into my mind
I can never put into exact words how much I care about you
Just knowing that there is even the chance of you having a bad day makes me want to make the long drive to come see you and make it better
You make all my problems more bearable and I hope that I do the same for you
If I could make a post on this sub everyday just to show you how much I love you I would
You are the stability I never had, the best friend I always wanted, and the guy I've always dreamed of
Thank you for letting me be your girl
Thank you for showing me what it's like to love and be loved
And most of all thank you for loving me for who I am
My husband has been my rock throughout this,  turns up to a&e making jokes and holding my hand
Is always there for me and is generally a lovely guy and my best friend
I have been desperate to go all my life and I am so excited to celebrate our marriage there and have fun with my best friend
I see the hunger in his eyes as he undresses me, and is it ever the most beautiful feeling in the world
To be seen stark naked, and having someone desire, want, and lust for you
I can‚Äôt get the mental image out of my head, where his eyes devour my body whole
I get excited just thinking of him naked on top of me
I‚Äôm up at 3am, craving for his touch and to feel his warm body pressed against my skin
He‚Äôs my fire and my desire
Lust is a beautiful drug
I want to stay up all night with someone cuddling, being goofy and genuine, not being able to get enough of each other
Not being able to go 10 seconds without kissing them, not feeling comfortable without one hand touching them at all times
I want someone to make me feel more at home than I do in the place I grew up, happier than any song or drug could ever make me feel
I want to sleep with my arms wrapped tightly around them, and notice their breath change as they eventually fall asleep
I want to be intoxicated by the smell of their clothes, their hair, their skin
I want to feel every bit of pain they feel, because the thought of them going through it alone is unbearable
Every minute I'm with her my life is complete
Dating for a couple years (5 years) and we want to get married
Both Can't afford it so we're going to get promise rings
Feel childish about it but I'm so happy I'm with her
I don't know if god is real but life is going pretty well for me right now
Never had somebody who pissed me off or made me so weak at the same time
Tonight I got to come home to the people who love me
Even if you're going home alone tonight, be grateful for that
Be grateful for home
please god, let me meet her
all I want to is to find that perfect girl i know exists
she‚Äôs sweet and shy and my age and likes all the things i do, perhaps even is on this site itself
the girl who won‚Äôt secretly think i‚Äôm a loser, the girl i can cuddle with (even if only possible online) and spent nights talking to and laughing and sharing happiness
someone who can reciprocate the love i put in, the girl who i can make feel safe and secure unconditionally and can fill this gaping, empty void in my heart
please, just let me find this person
i‚Äôll change everything about me if that‚Äôs what it takes please, i just can‚Äôt take the loneliness anymore
And then I smile
I just got back from one week of absolute bliss with my long-distance boyfriend
Let's just say that we both wish we could have prolonged the trip
I miss his arms around me while we sleep
I miss the way he smells and laughs and dances
I wish I could bottle him up and bring him back with me
I love him so much and he loves me just as much too
It's crazy how well we connected online and even more so in real life
Thank you Reddit, for helping me find the love of my life
Melted my heart, she's the best
I got hurt in football pulled a muscle had got hit in the eye not the best thing ever but my girlfriend is here she is the best love of my life she is so beautiful
He makes me so happy
Who would think that I would be able to find someone so perfect
I, being the self-deprecating idiot I am, have so many insecurities
He loves all of me
He loves the parts of me that I do not know how to love, and more
He completes me
I feel so safe when I‚Äôm in his arms
He‚Äôs my protector
His voice is deep and soothing
it never fails to calm me
This is love and this is real
I never thought ‚Äúhome‚Äù could be a person
He is my home
For me personally it was when my S/O and I were laying in her bed
I remember thinking to myself "I absolutely adore this woman" and it's one of my most cherished memories with her
we‚Äôve been together for 13 months now and it‚Äôs perfect
i couldn‚Äôt ask for anything more
she‚Äôs perfect for me and i‚Äôm perfect for her and everything is just amazing
we both have our flaws but we embrace them and learn how to handle them
we hang out somewhat often and our parents are accepting of the relationship
i couldn‚Äôt be any more happier with her
i love her so much and she knows i do and she loves me probably even more back
it makes me so happy knowing someone loves me
he admitted his feelings and i just said "well that's a relief because i think i like you too" this is the happiest i've been in a long time
I‚Äôm going to place my faith in your hands
I‚Äôm going to trust that you won‚Äôt cheat, that you‚Äôll stay loyal, that you won‚Äôt hurt, reject, or deceive me in any ways
And this takes a lot of vulnerability, but I‚Äôm going to try and fix my insecurities
I‚Äôm willing to heal from the damage that my ex left behind, and not pass any of my doubts and fears onto you
Because you are everything to me
And you deserve so much more than being half loved or being controlled
Have you ever met a girl so special that, after you met her, no girl seem to attract you any longer
I‚Äôm not allowed to love you
So I guess i will create vivid Fantasies of us being together
And because of my imagination I‚Äôm drifting further away from reality and only living in the world that i created where WE are actually together
Sometimes ‚ÄúThe One‚Äù isn‚Äôt always that person you meet, fall in love with, marry, have kids with and grow old together
Sometimes ‚ÄúThe One‚Äù is a person you only know for a short time and then you part ways
They come into your life and they‚Äôre not like any other and they come to mean so much in the brief moments you spend with them
You fall so long, deep, and hard that there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôd ever fall for anyone else again
That‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe One‚Äù
You may not grow old together
You may not take the usual path couples take
You may not even be a couple
But they are and always will be ‚ÄúThe One‚Äù
